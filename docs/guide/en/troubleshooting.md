# Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

If `doctor` reports `config_error`:

```powershell
smart-search setup
smart-search config list --format json
smart-search doctor --format markdown
```

If OpenAI-compatible `search` hangs or times out after `doctor` passes:

```powershell
smart-search doctor --format markdown
smart-search diagnose openai-compatible --format markdown
```

The diagnose report masks the API key and says whether the problem is missing config, the upstream/relay hanging on the real Smart Search prompt, or a stream/no-stream compatibility mismatch.

If search is slow:

- reduce `--extra-sources`;
- split broad questions into smaller queries;
- use `exa-search` or `zhipu-search` for source discovery, then `fetch` key pages.

If installed CLI health is uncertain:

```powershell
smart-search --help
smart-search --version
smart-search regression
smart-search smoke --mock --format json
```

On Windows npm/mise installs, verify non-ASCII JSON piping:

```powershell
smart-search deep "深度搜索一下最近的比特币行情" --format json | ConvertFrom-Json
```

## The CLI package updated but its runtime is not ready

Managers such as mise may skip npm lifecycle scripts, so the package version can change before its Python runtime exists. The App's Update CLI action verifies installation ownership, prepares that package's private Python environment, then checks actual execution. Failures retain their logs and allow a same-version retry after checking again. Ordinary refresh remains read-only. If no independent Python is available, use Shared independent CLI environment first. Running `smart-search --version` in a terminal may also repair a missing runtime, making the first invocation slower.

## App update failed or is unavailable

Retry the App check in Settings after restoring the network. A downloaded update still needs installation and restart. Finish App tasks, protected writes and unsaved drafts before proceeding. Windows development folders and old Inno installations must first use the new full installer; macOS test builds without an update key cannot update. Use only the official release matching your architecture. Signature or integrity failures must not be bypassed; keep using the installed version and report the error. App updates do not repair or upgrade the separate CLI/Skills automatically.

## macOS says the app is damaged or the developer cannot be verified

Download from this project's release page and check the DMG against that release's `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Open the DMG, drag **Smart Search** to **Applications**, then launch it from Applications. These are still unnotarized test packages.

“Damaged” does not necessarily mean a failed download. Before the packaging fix, v0.1.22 did not re-sign the assembled app, so verification reports `code has no resources but signature indicates they must be present`. Check the installed copy:

```bash
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 "/Applications/Smart Search.app"
```

If verification fails, use a new build containing the packaging fix. Do not just remove quarantine to hide an invalid signature. A matching SHA-256 only proves that the download matches the published file.

If verification passes but macOS blocks launch, follow [Apple's instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445) to use **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**. If this unnotarized test build still shows “damaged”, only after checking its official source, checksum and signature and deciding to trust it, remove the download quarantine flag from this app and reopen it:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Smart Search.app"
```

This targets only this app; do not disable Gatekeeper globally. Ad-hoc signing does not verify the publisher's identity or constitute Apple notarization.

## Interface language

Set the App language in Settings & about, and the independent CLI language with `smart-search config set SMART_SEARCH_LANGUAGE en`. If the CLI still uses another language, check a per-call `--lang` and the `SMART_SEARCH_LANGUAGE` environment override. `auto` follows the CLI locale, which can differ from the GUI session. Use `smart-search --lang en --help` to test without changing settings. Unreadable preferences fall back with a warning; repair that configuration file without deleting provider keys. Original page text and third-party logs do not change language.

## AI integration is still pending

Use Update Skills to check the stable source and select Agents with changed files; a software version change alone does not require Skill sync. An unready CLI does not block content sync, but prepare it under Shared independent CLI environment before making calls. If detection fails in Settings, read the specific reason, select Refresh installed versions, then check for updates. Matching files do not prove the Agent loaded the Skill. Reopen the session or use Gemini `/skills reload`, then verify the actual CLI version. Changed content is backed up and the result shows its recovery path. See [App setup](app.md).
